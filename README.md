## üë®‚Äçü¶± About Me

Knowledge problems excite me! 

Currently thinking about Feeds - current feeds are noisy and full of spam, and users have very little control over their daily information diet.
How can we give users more **meaningful control** over their feeds?
Chat with me on @Jason_Ys on Twitter if you're interested.

Currently Senior SWE at [You.com](https://you.com) - working on A/B tests, YouChat and ML.
